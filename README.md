Tasks needed (not necessarily in order, but kind of in order)

- To figure out what file format black magic I have to do for sceneform and hopefully draco
- Build model at runtime by manually adding files to the phones storage.
- Setup a download System, preferably after database type is known.
- Add gesture controller to Scene View for touch functionality
- Pre-render transparent model node at beginning of AR Activity
- If obj or ply becomes my final format method, setup draco
- Add orientation/Permission Activity screens to make it a journey for the user
- When location method is found out, implement showing restaurants by distance from user
- Add animations to recyclerCardview to make it smooth
- Setup a MemoryDumpSystem to get rid of files when no longer probably needed
- Replace poly models with real models, ->Optimize time it takes to present model
- Add an animated to stall the user as a model needs to be downloaded and rendered
- Split up the excessive code in Activities&Fragments to classes to different classes as needed
- Add a backTab/button to model views that shows name of restaurant
- Final Cleanup()
- Re-make Project in separate Repository
- Make Noni icons for all uses of Android phones
- Write up Android App Store stuff
- Ready !
